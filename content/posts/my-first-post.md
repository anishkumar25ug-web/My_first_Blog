Hi, I’m **Anish Kumar**. I’m someone who’s curious to know the unknown. Currently I am in Azim Premji University for Bachalors(Hons) Degree in Informaiton Science. I enjoy learning, questioning ideas, and make connections. For me, education isn’t just about textbooks or exams; it’s about understanding society, power, and change in a deeper way.I am deeply interested in bunch of activities like painting, playing sports like badmintion, singing, a bit of dancing and traveling.
Beyond academics, I value clarity, consistency, and curiosity. I try to approach new ideas with an open mind and a willingness to learn, even when they challenge my existing views. This blog is  a small space where I share thoughts, reflections, and ideas as I continue that journey.
